# 🎬 Netflix Movies Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my internship, where I performed a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Netflix Movies dataset**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding genre patterns, popularity trends, vote averages, and yearly movie distributions using Python.

- Categorize movies based on **vote_average**  
- Analyze **most frequent genres**  
- Identify **highest & lowest popularity movies**  
- Find genres with the highest average votes  
- Determine the **year with the most releases**  
- Visualize trends through bar charts, count plots, and distributions
